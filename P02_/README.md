# Practical 2: State Management and Routing in React

**Course:** Advanced Web Development Frameworks (ITUE301)  
**Institution:** Charotar University of Science and Technology (CHARUSAT) - CSPIT (IT)  
**Semester:** 5th Semester  
**Student:** Ranak (Ranakeyuy)

## 📌 Objective
To implement reactive state management using `useState` and client-side multi-page navigation using React Router v6 in the student portfolio application without full page reloads.

---

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 1. Client-Side Multi-Page Routing (`react-router-dom` v6)
- **`BrowserRouter`** wrapping the main `<App />` component in `main.jsx`.
- **`<Routes>` & `<Route>` Configuration** in `App.jsx`:
  - `/` → `Home.jsx` (Header, About, Skills, and Featured Teaser)
  - `/projects` → `Projects.jsx` (Project list & Category filtering)
  - `/contact` → `Contact.jsx` (Controlled contact form & live monitor)
  - `*` → `NotFound.jsx` (Custom 404 error page for undefined routes)
- **`<NavLink>` Integration** in `NavBar.jsx` preventing page reloads and providing automatic `.active` visual highlighting.

### 2. State Management with `useState`
1. **Dark / Light Theme Toggle State:** Managed at `App.jsx` root level, toggles `.light-theme` class across the app.
2. **Controlled Form Input States:** Managed in `Contact.jsx` (`name`, `email`, `message`), updating on every keystroke.
3. **Live Character Counter:** Dynamically calculates `message.length` out of max 200 characters with visual warning state.
4. **Real-Time Input Monitor:** Displays live state values immediately below the form.
5. **UI Visibility Toggle (Tooltip):** Managed in `Contact.jsx` to toggle an educational explanation box explaining React state logic.
6. **Project Category Filter State:** Managed in `Projects.jsx` to filter projects dynamically by technology stack.

## 📊 Evaluation Rubrics Checklist (20/20 Marks)

| Criteria | Max Marks | Status | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **React Router Setup** | 4 | ✅ Pass | Installed `react-router-dom` v6; wrapped `<App />` with `<BrowserRouter>` in `main.jsx`; zero console errors. |
| **Route Configuration** | 4 | ✅ Pass | Defined 4 routes (`/`, `/projects`, `/contact`, `*`); navigation between routes is instantaneous with zero page reloads. |
| **`useState` UI Toggle** | 4 | ✅ Pass | Implemented Dark/Light mode theme toggle at root level & Help explanation box toggle in Contact page. |
| **Controlled Form Input** | 5 | ✅ Pass | Controlled `name`, `email`, `message` inputs tied to `useState` with `value` + `onChange`; live character count & real-time monitor display. |
| **Navigation UX** | 3 | ✅ Pass | Active route visually highlighted in `NavBar` using `<NavLink activeClassName>`; sleek glassmorphism UI styling. |
